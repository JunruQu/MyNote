## MOSFET General Consideration
1. MOSFET is a four terminal device
2. Standard CMOS process: no deep well, all NMOSs' B terminal is equal potential. (for p substrate)
3. Deep N-well CMOS process
4. MOSFET in analog circuit:(1) as a switch; (2)as voltage controlled current source (VCCS)

## MOSFET Characteristics
1. Threshold Voltage (VTH)
	1. Process factor: tox increases, VTH decreases, Nsub increases, VTH increases
	2. Temperature: T increases, VTH decreases
	3. Body effect: VBS increases, VTH decreases
	4. DIBL effect: VDS increases, VTH decreases
2. I-V (Big Signal) Model
